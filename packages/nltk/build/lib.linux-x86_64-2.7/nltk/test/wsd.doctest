Word Sense Disambiguation
=========================


Lesk Algorithm
--------------


Performs the classic Lesk algorithm for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) using
a the definitions of the ambiguous word. 

Given an ambiguous word and the context in which the word occurs, Lesk returns 
a Synset with the highest number of overlapping words between the context 
sentence and different definitions from each Synset.

    >>> from nltk.wsd import lesk
	>>> from nltk import word_tokenize
	>>> sent = word_tokenize("I went to the bank to deposit money.")
	>>> word = "bank"
	>>> pos = "n"
	>>> print(lesk(sent, word, pos))
	Synset('depository_financial_institution.n.01')

The definitions for "bank" are:

	>>> from nltk.corpus import wordnet as wn
	>>> for ss in wn.synsets('bank'):
	...     print(ss, ss.definition())
	Synset('bank.n.01') sloping land (especially the slope beside a body of water)
	Synset('depository_financial_institution.n.01') a financial institution that accepts deposits and channels the money into lending activities
	Synset('bank.n.03') a long ridge or pile
	Synset('bank.n.04') an arrangement of similar objects in a row or in tiers
	Synset('bank.n.05') a supply or stock held in reserve for future use (especially in emergencies)
	Synset('bank.n.06') the funds held by a gambling house or the dealer in some gambling games
	Synset('bank.n.07') a slope in the turn of a road or track; the outside is higher than the inside in order to reduce the effects of centrifugal force
	Synset('savings_bank.n.02') a container (usually with a slot in the top) for keeping money at home
	Synset('bank.n.09') a building in which the business of banking transacted
	Synset('bank.n.10') a flight maneuver; aircraft tips laterally about its longitudinal axis (especially in turning)
	Synset('bank.v.01') tip laterally
	Synset('bank.v.02') enclose with a bank
	Synset('bank.v.03') do business with a bank or keep an account at a bank
	Synset('bank.v.04') act as the banker in a game or in gambling
	Synset('bank.v.05') be in the banking business
	Synset('deposit.v.02') put into a bank account
	Synset('bank.v.07') cover with ashes so to control the rate of burning
	Synset('trust.v.01') have confidence or faith in
